spreadsheet compare: match all the spreadsheet entries on a full list to the lists split alphabetically

1. Make sure you have Python downloaded. (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Download the most updated version of the Theater Programs Excel sheet (from the Sharepoint) and put it in the same folder with the Python script (or specify the pathname when running the file). (Save As Copy)
4. Use the command line to run the Python script. This will generate a text file report of differences between the Full List (x) and the Original Tabs (y).
5. Open report.txt to see how it's doing! At the end of the file is a summary of how many of the letters match, and beneath every letter is a summary of the plays that start with each letter.
